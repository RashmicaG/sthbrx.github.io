                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Be me, you're a kernel hacker, you make some changes to your kernel, you boot
test it in QEMU, and it fails to boot. Even worse is the fact that it just hangs
without any failure message, no stack trace, no nothing. "Now what?" you think
to yourself.</p>
<p>You probably do the first thing you learnt in debugging101 and add abundant
print statements all over the place to try and make some sense of what's
happening and where it is that you're actually crashing. So you do this, you
recompile your kernel, boot it in QEMU and lo and behold, nothing... What
happened? You added all these shiny new print statements, where did the output
go? The kernel still failed to boot (obviously), but where you were hoping to
get some clue to go on you were again left with an empty screen. "Maybe I
didn't print early enough" or "maybe I got the code paths wrong" you think,
"maybe I just need more prints" even. So lets delve a bit deeper, why didn't
you see those prints, where did they go, and how can you get at them?</p>
<h1>__log_buf</h1>
<p>So what happens when you call printk()? Well what normally happens is,
depending on the log level you set, the output is sent to the console or logged
so you can see it in dmesg. But what happens if we haven't registered a console
yet? Well then we can't print the message can we, so its logged in a buffer,
kernel log buffer to be exact helpfully named __log_buf.</p>
<h1>Console Registration</h1>
<p>So how come I eventually see print statements on my screen? Well at some point
during the boot process a console is registered with the printk system, and any
buffered output can now be displayed. On ppc it happens that this occurs in
register_early_udbg_console() called in setup_arch() from start_kernel(),
which is the generic kernel entry point. From this point forward when you print
something it will be displayed on the console, but what if you crash before
this? What are you supposed to do then?</p>
<h1>Extracting Early Boot Messages in QEMU</h1>
<p>And now the moment you've all been waiting for, how do I extract those early
boot messages in QEMU if my kernel crashes before the console is registered?
Well it's quite simple really, QEMU is nice enough to allow us to dump guest
memory, and we know the log buffer is in there some where, so we just need to
dump the correct part of memory which corresponds to the log buffer.</p>
<h4>Locating __log_buf</h4>
<p>Before we can dump the log buffer we need to know where it is. Luckily for us
this is fairly simple, we just need to dump all the kernel symbols and look for
the right one.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">nm</span> <span class="n">vmlinux</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">tmp</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">grep</span> <span class="n">__log_buf</span> <span class="n">tmp</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">c000000000f5e3dc</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="n">__log_buf</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We use the nm tool to list all the kernel symbols and output this into some
temporary file, we can then grep this for the log buffer (which we know to be
named __log_buf), and presto we are told that it's at kernel address 0xf5e3dc.</p>
<h4>Dumping Guest Memory</h4>
<p>It's then simply a case of dumping guest memory from the QEMU console. So first
we press ^a+c to get us to the QEMU console, then we can use the aptly named
dump-guest-memory.</p>

</pre></div>


<p>We just give it a filename for where we want our output to go, we know the
starting address, we just don't know the length. We could choose some arbitrary
length, but inspection of the kernel code shows us that:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="cp">#define __LOG_BUF_LEN (1 &lt;&lt; CONFIG_LOG_BUF_SHIFT)</span>
<span class="k">static</span> <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="n">__log_buf</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">__LOG_BUF_LEN</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="n">__aligned</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">LOG_ALIGN</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Looking at the pseries_defconfig file shows us that the LOG_BUF_SHIFT is set to
18, and thus we know that the buffer is 2^18 bytes or 256kb. So now we run:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">dump</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">guest</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">memory</span> <span class="n">tmp</span> <span class="mh">0xf5e3dc</span> <span class="mi">262144</span>
</pre></div>


<p>And we now get our log buffer in the file tmp. This can simply be viewed with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">hexdump</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">C</span> <span class="n">tmp</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This gives a readable, if poorly formatted output. I'm sure you can find
something better but I'll leave that as an exercise for the reader.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>So if like me your kernel hangs somewhere early in the boot process and you're
left without your console output you are now fully equipped to extract the log
buffer in QEMU and hopefully therein lies the answer to why you failed to boot.</p> </div><!-- /.entry-content -->

                </footer><!-- /.post-info -->
                <div class="entry-content"> <p>It started off a regular Wednesday morning when I hear from my desk a colleague
muttering about doubles and their hex representation. "But that doesn't look
right", "How do I read this as a float", and "<del>redacted</del> you're the engineer,
you do it". My interest piqued, I headed over to his desk to enquire about the
great un-solvable mystery of the double and its hex representation. The number
which would consume me for the rest of the morning: 0xc00000001568fba0.</p>
<h2>That's a Perfectly Valid hex Number!</h2>
<p>I hear you say. And you're right, if we were to treat this as a long it
would simply be 13835058055641365408 (or -4611686018068186208 if we assume
a signed value). But we happen to know that this particular piece of data which
we have printed is supposed to represent a double (-2 to be precise). "Well
print it as a double" I hear from the back, and once again we <em>should</em> all know
that this can be achieved rather easily by using the %f/%e/%g specifiers in our
print statement. The only problem is that in kernel land (where we use printk)
we are limited to printing fixed point numbers, hence why our only <em>easy</em>
option was to print our double in it's raw hex format.</p>
<p>This is the point where we all think back to that university course where
number representations were covered in depth, and terms like 'mantissa' and
'exponent' surface in our minds. Of course as we rack our brains we realise
there's no way that we're going to remember exactly how a double is represented
and bring up the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format">IEEE 754 Wikipedia page</a>.</p>
<h2>What is a Double?</h2>
<p>Taking a step back for a second, a double (or a double-precision floating-point)
is a number format used to represent floating-point numbers (those with a
decimal component). They are made up of a sign bit, an exponent and a fraction
(or mantissa):</p>
<p><img alt="Double Format" src="/images/surajjs/doubles_in_hex/double.png"></p>
<p>Where the number they represent is defined by:</p>
<p><img alt="Double Formula" src="/images/surajjs/doubles_in_hex/formula.png"></p>
<p>So this means that a 1 in the MSB (sign bit) represents a negative number, and
we have some decimal component (the fraction) which we multiply by some power
of 2 (as determined by the exponent) to get our value.</p>
<h2>Alright, so what's 0xc00000001568fba0?</h2>
<p>The reason we're all here to be begin with, so what's 0xc00000001568fba0 if we
treat it as a double? We can first split it into the three components:</p>
<h5>0xc00000001568fba0:</h5>
<p>Sign bit: 1             -&gt; Negative<br>
Exponent: 0x400         -&gt; 2<sup>(1024 - 1023)</sup><br>
Fraction: 0x1568fba0    -&gt; 1.<em>something</em><br></p>
<p>And then use the formula above to get our number:</p>
<p>(-1)<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> x 1.<em><strong>something</strong></em> x 2<sup><strong>(1024 - 1023)</strong></sup></p>
<p><strong>But there's a much easier way!</strong> Just write ourselves a little program in
userspace (where we are capable of printing floats) and we can save ourselves
<em>most</em> of the trouble.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="cp">#include</span> <span class="cpf">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span class="cp"></span>

<span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kt">long</span> <span class="n">val</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mh">0xc00000001568fba0</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;val: %lf</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="kt">double</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">val</span><span class="p">));</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>So all we're doing is taking our hex value and storing it in a long (val), then
getting a pointer to val, casting it to a double pointer, and dereferencing it
and printing it as a float. <em><strong>Drum Roll</strong></em> And the answer is?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"val: -2.000000"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Wait a minute, that doesn't quite sound right". You're right, it does seem a
bit strange that this is exactly -2. Well it may be that we are not printing
enough decimal places to see the full result, so update our print statement to:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;val: %.64lf</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="kt">double</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">val</span><span class="p">));</span>
</pre></div>


<p>And now we get:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"val: -2.0000001595175973534423974342644214630126953125000000"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Much better... But still where did this number come from and why wasn't it the
-2 that we were expecting?</p>
<h2>Kernel Pointers</h2>
<p>At this point suspicions had been raised that what was being printed by my
colleague was not what he expected and that this was in fact a Kernel pointer.
How do you know? Lets take a step back for a second...</p>
<p>In the PowerPC architecture, the address space which can be seen by an
application is known as the <em>effective</em> address space. We can take this
and translate it into a <em>virtual</em> address which when mapped through the
HPT (hash page table) gives us a <em>real</em> address (or the hardware memory address).</p>
<p>The <em>effective</em> address space is divided into 5 regions:</p>
<p><img alt="Effective Address Table" src="/images/surajjs/doubles_in_hex/effective_address.png"></p>
<p>As you may notice, Kernel addresses begin with 0xc. This has the advantage that
we can map a <em>virtual</em> address without the need for a table by simply
masking the top nibble.</p>
<p>Thus it would be reasonable to assume that our value (0xc00000001568fba0) was
indeed a pointer to a Kernel address (and further code investigation confirmed
this).</p>
<h2>But What is -2 as a Double in hex?</h2>
<p>Well lets modify the above program and find out:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">include</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">stdio</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">h</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>

<span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">main</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="kt">double</span> <span class="n">val</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span>

        <span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;val: 0x%lx</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="kt">long</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">val</span><span class="p">));</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Result?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"val: 0xc000000000000000"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that sounds much better. Lets take a closer look:</p>
<h5>0xc000000000000000:</h5>
<p>Sign Bit: 1     -&gt; Negative<br>
Exponent: 0x400 -&gt; 2<sup>(1024 - 1023)</sup><br>
Fraction: 0x0   -&gt; Zero<br></p>
<p>So if you remember from above, we have:</p>
<p>(-1)<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> x 1.<em><strong>0</strong></em> x 2<sup><strong>(1024 - 1023)</strong></sup> = -2</p>
<p>What about -1? -3?</p>
<h4>-1:</h4>
<h5>0xbff0000000000000:</h5>
<p>Sign Bit: 1     -&gt; Negative<br>
Exponent: 0x3ff -&gt; 2<sup>(1023 - 1023)</sup><br>
Fraction: 0x0   -&gt; Zero<br></p>
<p>(-1)<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> x 1.<em><strong>0</strong></em> x 2<sup><strong>(1023 - 1023)</strong></sup> = -1</p>
<h4>-3:</h4>
<h5>0xc008000000000000:</h5>
<p>Sign Bit: 1                     -&gt; Negative<br>
Exponent: 0x400                 -&gt; 2<sup>(1024 - 1023)</sup><br>
Fraction: 0x8000000000000       -&gt; 0.5<br></p>
<p>(-1)<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> x 1.<em><strong>5</strong></em> x 2<sup><strong>(1024 - 1023)</strong></sup> = -3</p>
<h2>So What Have We Learnt?</h2>
<p><strong>Firstly</strong>, make sure that what you're printing is what you think you're printing.</p>
<p><strong>Secondly</strong>, if it looks like a Kernel pointer then you're probably not printing
what you think you're printing.</p>
<p><strong>Thirdly</strong>, all Kernel pointers ~= -2 if you treat them as a double.</p>
<p>And <strong>Finally</strong>, <em>with my morning gone</em>, I can say for certain that if we treat it as
a double, 0xc00000001568fba0 =
-2.0000001595175973534423974342644214630126953125.</p> </div><!-- /.entry-content -->
