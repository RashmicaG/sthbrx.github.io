    <p>Docker's default storage driver on most Ubuntu installs is AUFS.</p>
<p>Don't use it. Use Overlay instead. Here's why.</p>
<p>First, some background. I'm testing the performance of the basic LAMP
stack on POWER. (LAMP is Linux + Apache + MySQL/MariaDB + PHP, by the
way.) To do more reliable and repeatable tests, I do my builds and
tests in Docker containers. (See <a href="/blog/2015/10/12/a-tale-of-two-dockers/">my previous post</a> for more info.)</p>
<p>Each test downloads the source of Apache, MariaDB and PHP, and builds
them. This should be quick: the POWER8 system I'm building on has 160
hardware threads and 128 GB of memory. But I was finding that it was
only just keeping pace with a 2 core Intel VM on BlueMix.</p>
<p>Why? Well, my first point of call was to observe a compilation under
<code>top</code>. The header is below.</p>
<p><img alt="top header, showing over 70 percent of CPU time spent in the kernel" src="/images/dja/aufs/top-bad.png"></p>
<p>Over 70% of CPU time is spent in the kernel?! That's weird. Let's dig
deeper.</p>
<p>My next port of call for analysis of CPU-bound workloads is
<code>perf</code>. <code>perf top</code> reports astounding quantities of time in
spin-locks:</p>
<p><img alt="display from perf top, showing 80 percent of time in a spinlock" src="/images/dja/aufs/perf-top-spinlock.png"></p>
<p><code>perf top -g</code> gives us some more information: the time is in system
calls. <code>open()</code> and <code>stat()</code> are the key culprits, and we can see a
number of file system functions are in play in the call-chains of the
spinlocks.</p>
<p><img alt="display from perf top -g, showing syscalls and file ops" src="/images/dja/aufs/perf-top-syscalls.png"></p>
<p>Why are open and stat slow? Well, I know that the files are on an AUFS
mount. (<code>docker info</code> will tell you what you're using if you're not
sure.) So, being something of a kernel hacker, I set out to find out
why. This did not go well. AUFS isn't upstream, it's a separate patch
set. Distros have been trying to deprecate it for years. Indeed, RHEL
doesn't ship it. (To it's credit, Docker seems to be trying to move
away from it.)</p>
<p>Wanting to avoid the minor nightmare that is an out-of-tree patchset,
I looked at other storage drivers for Docker. <a href="https://jpetazzo.github.io/assets/2015-03-03-not-so-deep-dive-into-docker-storage-drivers.html">This presentation is particularly good.</a>
My choices are pretty simple: AUFS, btrfs, device-mapper or
Overlay. Overlay was an obvious choice: it doesn't need me to set up
device mapper on a cloud VM, or reformat things as btrfs.</p>
<p>It's also easy to set up on Ubuntu:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>export/save any docker containers you care about.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>add <code>--storage-driver=overlay</code> option to <code>DOCKER_OPTS</code> in <code>/etc/default/docker</code>, and restart docker (<code>service docker restart</code>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>import/load the containters you exported</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>verify that things work, then clear away your old storage directory (<code>/var/lib/docker/aufs</code>). </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Having moved my base container across, I set off another build.</p>
<p>The first thing I noticed is that images are much slower to create with Overlay. But once that finishes, and a compile starts, things run much better:</p>
<p><img alt="top, showing close to zero system time, and around 90 percent user time" src="/images/dja/aufs/top-good.png"></p>
<p>The compiles went from taking painfully long to astonishingly fast. Winning.</p>
<p>So in conclusion:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you use Docker for something that involves open()ing or stat()ing files</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want your machine to do real work, rather than spin in spinlocks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to use code that's upstream and thus much better supported</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want something less disruptive than the btrfs or dm storage drivers</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>...then drop AUFS and switch to Overlay today.</p>
