                <div class="entry-content"> <h2>The "problem"</h2>
<p>I'm currently working on firmware and kernel support for <a href="http://opencapi.org/">OpenCAPI</a> on POWER9.</p>
<p>I've recently been allocated a machine in the lab for development purposes. We use an internal IBM tool running on a secondary machine that triggers hardware initialisation procedures, then loads a specified <a href="https://github.com/open-power/skiboot">skiboot</a> firmware image, a kernel image, and a root file system directly into RAM. This allows us to get skiboot and Linux running without requiring the usual <a href="https://github.com/open-power/hostboot">hostboot</a> initialisation and gives us a lot of options for easier tinkering, so it's super-useful for our developers working on bringup.</p>
<p>When I got access to my machine, I figured out the necessary scripts, developed a workflow, and started fixing my code... so far, so good.</p>
<p>One day, I was trying to debug something and get logs off the machine using <code>ssh</code> and <code>scp</code>, when I got frustrated with having to repeatedly type in our ultra-secret, ultra-secure root password, <code>abc123</code>. So, I ran <code>ssh-copy-id</code> to copy over my public key, and all was good.</p>
<p>Until I rebooted the machine, when strangely, my key stopped working. It took me longer than it should have to realise that this is an obvious consequence of running entirely from an initrd that's reloaded every boot...</p>
<h2>The "solution"</h2>
<p>I mentioned something about this to Jono, my housemate/partner-in-stupid-ideas, one evening a few weeks ago. We decided that clearly, the best way to solve this problem was to hardcode my SSH public key in the kernel.</p>
<p>This would definitely be the easiest and most sensible way to solve the problem, as opposed to, say, just keeping my own copy of the root filesystem image. Or asking <a href="https://twitter.com/mikeyneuling">Mikey</a>, whose desk is three metres away from mine, whether he could use his write access to add my key to the image. Or just writing a wrapper around <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/sshpass">sshpass</a>...</p>
<p>One Tuesday afternoon, I was feeling bored...</p>
<h2>The approach</h2>
<p>The SSH daemon looks for authorised public keys in <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>, so we need to have a read of <code>/root/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> return a specified hard-coded string.</p>
<p>I did a bit of investigation. My first thought was to put some kind of hook inside whatever filesystem driver was being used for the root. After some digging, I found out that the filesystem type <code>rootfs</code>, as seen in <code>mount</code>, is actually backed by the <code>tmpfs</code> filesystem. I took a look around the <code>tmpfs</code> code for a while, but didn't see any way to hook in a fake file without a lot of effort - the <code>tmpfs</code> code wasn't exactly designed with this in mind.</p>
<p>I thought about it some more - what would be the easiest way to create a file such that it just returns a string?</p>
<p>Then I remembered sysfs, the filesystem normally mounted at <code>/sys</code>, which is used by various kernel subsystems to expose configuration and debugging information to userspace in the form of files. The sysfs API allows you to define a file and specify callbacks to handle reads and writes to the file.</p>
<p>That got me thinking - could I create a file in <code>/sys</code>, and then use a <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/198590/what-is-a-bind-mount">bind mount</a> to have that file appear where I need it in <code>/root/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>? This approach seemed fairly straightforward, so I decided to give it a try.</p>
<p>First up, creating a pseudo-file. It had been a while since the last time I'd used the sysfs API...</p>
<h2>sysfs</h2>
<p>The sysfs pseudo file system was first introduced in Linux 2.6, and is generally used for exposing system and device information.</p>
<p>Per the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/sysfs.txt">sysfs documentation</a>, sysfs is tied in very closely with the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/kobject.txt">kobject</a> infrastructure. sysfs exposes kobjects as directories, containing "attributes" represented as files. The kobject infrastructure provides a way to define kobjects representing entities (e.g. devices) and ksets which define collections of kobjects (e.g. devices of a particular type).</p>
<p>Using kobjects you can do lots of fancy things such as sending events to userspace when devices are hotplugged - but that's all out of the scope of this post. It turns out there's some fairly straightforward wrapper functions if all you want to do is create a kobject just to have a simple directory in sysfs.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="cp">#include</span> <span class="cpf">&lt;linux/kobject.h&gt;</span><span class="cp"></span>

<span class="k">static</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">__init</span> <span class="nf">ssh_key_init</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="p">)</span>

        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="n">ssh_kobj</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="n">late_initcall</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ssh_key_init</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This creates and adds a kobject called <code>ssh</code>. And just like that, we've got a directory in <code>/sys/ssh/</code>!</p>
<p>The next thing we have to do is define a sysfs attribute for our <code>authorized_keys</code> file. sysfs provides a framework for subsystems to define their own custom types of attributes with their own metadata - but for our purposes, we'll use the generic <code>bin_attribute</code> attribute type.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="cp">#include</span> <span class="cpf">&lt;linux/sysfs.h&gt;</span><span class="cp"></span>

<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We provide a simple callback, <code>show_key()</code>, that copies the key string into the file's buffer, and we put it in a <code>bin_attribute</code> with the appropriate name, size and permissions.</p>
<p>To actually add the attribute, we put the following in <code>ssh_key_init()</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">rc</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">rc</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">sysfs_create_bin_file</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ssh_kobj</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">authorized_keys_attr</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">rc</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">rc</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Woo, we've now got <code>/sys/ssh/authorized_keys</code>! Time to move on to the bind mount.</p>
<h2>Mounting</h2>
<p>Now that we've got a directory with the key file in it, it's time to figure out the bind mount.</p>
<p>Because I had no idea how any of the file system code works, I started off by running <code>strace</code> on <code>mount --bind ~/tmp1 ~/tmp2</code> just to see how the userspace <code>mount</code> tool uses the <code>mount</code> syscall to request the bind mount.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">execve</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;/bin/mount&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&quot;mount&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;--bind&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;/home/ajd/tmp1&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;/home/ajd/tmp2&quot;</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="cm">/* 18 vars */</span><span class="p">])</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>

<span class="p">...</span>

<span class="n">mount</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;/home/ajd/tmp1&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;/home/ajd/tmp2&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mh">0x18b78bf00</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">MS_MGC_VAL</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="n">MS_BIND</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">NULL</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The first and second arguments are the source and target paths respectively. The third argument, looking at the signature of the <code>mount</code> syscall, is a pointer to a string with the file system type. Because this is a bind mount, the type is irrelevant (upon further digging, it turns out that this particular pointer is to the string "none").</p>
<p>The fourth argument is where we specify the flags bitfield. <code>MS_MGC_VAL</code> is a magic value that was required before Linux 2.4 and can now be safely ignored. <code>MS_BIND</code>, as you can probably guess, signals that we want a bind mount.</p>
<p>(The final argument is used to pass file system specific data - as you can see it's ignored here.)</p>
<p>Now, how is the syscall actually handled on the kernel side? The answer is found in <a href="http://elixir.free-electrons.com/linux/latest/source/fs/namespace.c#L2969">fs/namespace.c</a>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">SYSCALL_DEFINE5</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">mount</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="n">__user</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">dev_name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="n">__user</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">dir_name</span><span class="p">,</span>
                <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="n">__user</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">type</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">unsigned</span> <span class="kt">long</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">flags</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">__user</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">ret</span><span class="p">;</span>

        <span class="cm">/* ... copy parameters from userspace memory ... */</span>

        <span class="n">ret</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">do_mount</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">kernel_dev</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">dir_name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">kernel_type</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">flags</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">options</span><span class="p">);</span>

        <span class="cm">/* ... cleanup ... */</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>So in order to achieve the same thing from within the kernel, we just call <code>do_mount()</code> with exactly the same parameters as the syscall uses:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">rc</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">do_mount</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;/sys/ssh&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;/root/.ssh&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;sysfs&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">MS_BIND</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">NULL</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">rc</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="n">pr_err</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;SSH: bind mount failed, rc %d</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">rc</span><span class="p">);</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">rc</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>...and we're done, right? Not so fast:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">SSH</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">bind</span> <span class="n">mount</span> <span class="n">failed</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">rc</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">2</span>
</pre></div>


<p>-2 is <code>ENOENT</code> - no such file or directory. For some reason, we can't find <code>/sys/ssh</code>... of course, that would be because even though we've created the sysfs entry, we haven't actually mounted sysfs on <code>/sys</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">rc</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">do_mount</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;sysfs&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;/sys&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;sysfs&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
              <span class="n">MS_NOSUID</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">MS_NOEXEC</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">MS_NODEV</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">NULL</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>At this point, my key worked!</p>
<p>Note that this requires that your root file system has an empty directory created at <code>/sys</code> to be the mount point. Additionally, in a typical Linux distribution environment (as opposed to my hardware bringup environment), your initial root file system will contain an init script that mounts your real root file system somewhere and calls <code>pivot_root()</code> to switch to the new root file system. At that point, the bind mount won't be visible from children processes using the new root - I think this could be worked around but would require some effort.</p>
<h2>Kconfig</h2>
<p>The final piece of the puzzle is building our new code into the kernel image.</p>
<p>To allow us to switch this important functionality on and off, I added a config option to <code>fs/Kconfig</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>config SSH_KEY
        bool &quot;Andrew&#39;s dumb SSH key hack&quot;
        default y
        help
          Hardcode an SSH key for /root/.ssh/authorized_keys.

          This is a stupid idea. If unsure, say N.
</pre></div>


<p>This will show up in <code>make menuconfig</code> under the <code>File systems</code> menu.</p>
<p>And in <code>fs/Makefile</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nv">obj-$(CONFIG_SSH_KEY)</span>           <span class="o">+=</span> ssh_key.o
</pre></div>


<p>If <code>CONFIG_SSH_KEY</code> is set to <code>y</code>, <code>obj-$(CONFIG_SSH_KEY)</code> evaluates to <code>obj-y</code> and thus <code>ssh-key.o</code> gets compiled. Conversely, <code>obj-n</code> is completely ignored by the build system.</p>
<p>I thought I was all done... then <a href="https://twitter.com/mramboar">Andrew</a> suggested I make the contents of the key configurable, and I had to oblige. Conveniently, Kconfig options can also be strings:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>config SSH_KEY_VALUE
        string &quot;Value for SSH key&quot;
        depends on SSH_KEY
        help
          Enter in the content for /root/.ssh/authorized_keys.
</pre></div>


<p>Including the string in the C file is as simple as:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">const</span> <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="n">key</span><span class="p">[]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">CONFIG_SSH_KEY_VALUE</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>And there we have it, a nicely configurable albeit highly limited kernel SSH backdoor!</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I've put the <a href="https://github.com/ajdlinux/linux/commit/052c0cb7296f7510fd482fecbe572b641c29239f">full code</a> up on GitHub for perusal. Please don't use it, I will be extremely disappointed in you if you do.</p>
<p>Thanks to Jono for giving me stupid ideas, and the rest of OzLabs for being very angry when they saw the disgusting things I was doing.</p>

<h2>NCSI - Not the TV Show</h2>
<p>NCSI stands for Network Controller Sideband Interface, and put most simply it
is a way for a management controller (eg. a BMC like those found on our OpenPOWER
machines) to share a single physical network interface with a host machine.
Instead of two distinct network interfaces you plug in a single cable and both
the host and the BMC have network connectivity.</p>
<p>NCSI-capable network controllers achieve this by filtering network traffic as
it arrives and determining if it is host- or BMC-bound. To know how to do this
the BMC needs to tell the network controller what to look out for, and from a
Linux driver perspective this the focus of the NCSI protocol.</p>
<p><img alt="NCSI Overview" src="/images/sammj/ncsi_overview.png"></p>
<h2>Hi My Name Is 70:e2:84:14:24:a1</h2>
<p>The major components of what NCSI helps facilitate are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Network Controllers, known as 'Packages' in this context. There may be multiple
  separate packages which contain one or more Channels.</li>
<li>Channels, most easily thought of as the individual physical network interfaces.
  If a package is the network card, channels are the individual network jacks. (Somewhere a pedant's head is spinning in circles).</li>
<li>Management Controllers, or our BMC, with their own network interfaces. Hypothetically there can be multiple
  management controllers in a single NCSI system, but I've not come across such
  a setup yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>NCSI is the medium and protocol via which these components communicate.</p>
<p><img alt="NCSI Packages" src="/images/sammj/ncsi_packages.png"></p>
<p>The interface between Management Controller and one or more
Packages carries both general network traffic to/from the Management
Controller as well as NCSI traffic between the Management Controller
and the Packages &amp; Channels. Management traffic is differentiated from
regular traffic via the inclusion of a special NCSI tag inserted
in the Ethernet frame header.
These management commands are used to discover and configure the state of the
NCSI packages and channels.</p>
<p>If a BMC's network interface is configured to use NCSI, as soon as the interface
is brought up NCSI gets to work finding and configuring a usable channel.
The NCSI driver at first glance is an intimidating combination of state machines
and packet handlers, but with enough coffee it can be represented like this:</p>
<p><img alt="NCSI State Diagram" src="/images/sammj/ncsi_states.png"></p>
<p>Without getting into the nitty gritty details the overall process for configuring
a channel enough to get packets flowing is fairly straightforward:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find available packages.</li>
<li>Find each package's available channels.</li>
<li>(At least in the Linux driver) select a channel with link.</li>
<li>Put this channel into the Initial Config State.
The Initial Config State is where all the useful configuration occurs. Here we
find out what the selected channel is capable of and its current configuration,
and set it up to recognise the traffic we're interested in. The first and most
basic way of doing this is configuring the channel to filter traffic based on
our MAC address.</li>
<li>Enable the channel and let the packets flow.</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point NCSI takes a back seat to normal network traffic, transmitting
a "Get Link Status" packet at regular intervals to monitor the channel.</p>
<h2>AEN Packets</h2>
<p>Changes can occur from the package side too; the NCSI package communicates these
back to the BMC with Asynchronous Event Notification (AEN) packets. As the name
suggests these can occur at any time and the driver needs to catch and handle these.
There are different types but they essentially boil down to changes in link state,
telling the BMC the channel needs to be reconfigured, or to select a different
channel.
These are only transmitted once and no effort is made to recover lost AEN packets -
another good reason for the NCSI driver to periodically monitor the channel.</p>
<h2>Filtering</h2>
<p>Each channel can be configured to filter traffic based on MAC address,
broadcast traffic, multicast traffic, and VLAN tagging. Associated with each of
these filters is a <em>filter table</em> which can hold a finite number of entries.
In the case of the VLAN filter each channel could match against 15 different
VLAN IDs for example, but in practice the physical device will likely
support less. Indeed the popular BCM5718 controller supports only two!</p>
<p>This is where I dived into NCSI. The driver had a lot of the pieces for
configuring VLAN filters but none of it was actually hooked up in the configure
state, and didn't have a way of actually knowing which VLAN IDs were meant to be
configured on the interface. The bulk of that work appears in <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/21acf63013ed3d6fce3176cc34b74064052a31b4#diff-f391518f4e552724349be3589e00dfa7">this commit</a> where we take advantage of some useful network stack callbacks to get the VLAN configuration and set them during the configuration state. Getting <em>to</em> the configuration state at some arbitrary time and then managing to assign multiple IDs was the trickiest bit, and is something I'll be looking at simplifying in the future.</p>
<hr>
<p>NCSI! A neat way to give physically separate users access to a single network controller, and if it works right you won't notice it at all. I'll surely be spending more time here (fleshing out the driver's features, better error handling, and making the state machine a touch more readable to start, and I haven't even <em>mentioned</em> HWA), so watch this space!</p> </div><!-- /.entry-content -->

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>This entry is a followup to part I which you should absolutely read
<a href="https://sthbrx.github.io/blog/2017/08/07/memcmp-for-power8/">here</a> before continuing
on.</p>
<h2>Where we left off</h2>
<p>We concluded that while a vectorised <code>memcmp()</code> is a win, there are
some cases where it won't quite perform.</p>
<h2>The overhead of enabling ALTIVEC</h2>
<p>In the kernel we explicitly don't touch ALTIVEC unless we need to,
this means that in the general case we can leave the userspace
registers in place and not have do anything to service a syscall for a
process.</p>
<p>This means that if we do want to use ALTIVEC in the kernel, there is
some setup that must be done. Notably, we must enable the facility (a
potentially time consuming move to MSR), save off the registers (if
userspace we using them) and an inevitable restore later on.</p>
<p>If all this needs to be done for a <code>memcmp()</code> in the order of tens of
bytes then it really wasn't worth it.</p>
<p>There are two reasons that <code>memcmp()</code> might go for a small number of
bytes, firstly and trivially detectable is simply that parameter n is
small. The other is harder to detect, if the memcmp() is going to fail
(return non zero) early then it also wasn't worth enabling ALTIVEC.</p>
<h2>Detecting early failures</h2>
<p>Right at the start of <code>memcmp()</code>, before enabling ALTIVEC, the first
64 bytes are checked using general purpose registers. Why the first 64
bytes, well why not? In a strange twist of fate 64 bytes happens to be
the amount of bytes in four ALTIVEC registers (128 bits per register,
so 16 bytes multiplied by 4) and by utter coincidence that happens to
be the stride of the ALTIVEC compare loop.</p>
<h2>What does this all look like</h2>
<p>Well unlike part I the results appear slightly less consistent across
three runs of measurement but there are some very key differences with
part I. The trends do appear to be the same across all three runs,
just less pronounced - why this is is unclear.</p>
<p>The difference between run two and run three clipped at deltas of
1000ns is interesting:
<img alt="Sample 2: Deltas below 1000ns" src="/images/power8_memcmp/v2deltas2-1000.png" title="Sample 2: Deltas below 1000ns"></p>
<p>vs</p>
<p><img alt="Sample 3: Deltas below 1000ns" src="/images/power8_memcmp/v2deltas3-1000.png" title="Sample 3: Deltas below 1000ns"></p>
<p>The results are similar except for a spike in the amount of deltas in
the unpatched kernel at around 600ns. This is not present in the first
sample (deltas1) of data. There are a number of reasons why this spike
could have appeared here, it is possible that the kernel or hardware
did something under the hood, prefetch could have brought deltas for a
<code>memcmp()</code> that would otherwise have yielded a greater delta into the
600ns range.</p>
<p>What these two graphs do both demonstrate quite clearly is that
optimisations down at the sub 100ns end have resulted in more sub
100ns deltas for the patched kernel, a significant win over the
original data. Zooming out and looking at a graph which includes
deltas up to 5000ns shows that the sub 100ns delta optimisations
haven't noticeably slowed the performance of long duration <code>memcmp()</code>,
<img alt="Samply 2: Deltas below 5000ns" src="/images/power8_memcmp/v2deltas2-5000.png" title="Sample 2: Deltas below 5000ns">.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The small amount of extra development effort has yielded tangible
results in reducing the low end <code>memcmp()</code> times. This second round of
data collection and performance analysis only confirms the that for
any significant amount of comparison, a vectorised loop is
significantly quicker.</p>
<p>The results obtained here show no downside to adopting this approach
for all power8 and onwards chips as this new version of the patch
solves the performance regression for small compares.</p> </div><!-- /.entry-content -->

                <div class="entry-content"> <h2>Userspace</h2>
<p>When writing C programs in userspace there is libc which does so much
of the heavy lifting. One important thing libc provides is portability
in performing syscalls, that is, you don't need to know the
architectural details of performing a syscall on each architecture
your program might be compiled for. Another important feature that
libc provides for the average userspace programmer is highly optimised
routines to do things that are usually performance critical. It would
be extremely inefficient for each userspace programmer if they had to
implement even the naive version of these functions let alone
optimised versions. Let us take <code>memcmp()</code> for example, I could
trivially implement this in C like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">memcmp</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">uint8_t</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">p1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">uint8_t</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">p2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

            <span class="k">return</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">p1</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">p2</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">])</span>
            <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>However, while it is incredibly portable it is simply not going to
perform, which is why the nice people who write libc have highly
optimised ones in assembly for each architecture.</p>
<h2>Kernel</h2>
<p>When writing code for the Linux kernel, there isn't the luxury of a
fully featured libc since it expects (and needs) to be in userspace,
therefore we need to implement the features we need ourselves. Linux
doesn't need all the features but something like <code>memcmp()</code> is
definitely a requirement.</p>
<p>There have been some recent optimisations in <a href="https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob_plain;f=sysdeps/powerpc/powerpc64/power8/memcmp.S;h=46b9c0067ad7cd74a36c4800ebfe03eb1be0311e;hb=dec4a7105edcdbabdcac5f358f5bc5dca4f4ed1b" title="power8 optimised memcmp">glibc</a> from which the
kernel could benefit too! The question to be asked is, does the glibc
optimised <code>power8_memcmp()</code> actually go faster or is it all smoke and
mirrors?</p>
<h2>Benchmarking <code>memcmp()</code></h2>
<p>With things like <code>memcmp()</code> it is actually quite easy to choose
datasets which can make any implementation look good. For example; the
new <code>power8_memcmp()</code> makes use of the vector unit of the power8
processor, in order to do so in the kernel there must be a small
amount of setup code so that the rest of the kernel knows that the
vector unit has been used and it correctly saves and restores the
userspace vector registers. This means that <code>power8_memcmp()</code> has a
slightly larger overhead than the current one, so for small compares
or compares which are different early on then the newer 'faster'
<code>power8_memcmp()</code> might actually not perform as well. For any kind of
large compare however, using the vector unit should outperform a CPU
register load and compare loop. It is for this reason that I wanted to
avoid using micro benchmarks and use a 'real world' test as much as
possible.</p>
<p>The biggest user of <code>memcmp()</code> in the kernel, at least on POWER is Kernel
Samepage Merging (KSM). KSM provides code to inspect all the pages of
a running system to determine if they're identical and deduplicate
them if possible. This kind of feature allows for memory overcommit
when used in a KVM host environment as guest kernels are likely to
have a lot of similar, readonly pages which can be merged with no
overhead afterwards. In order to determine if the pages are the same
KSM must do a lot of page sized <code>memcmp()</code>.</p>
<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>Performing a lot of page sized <code>memcmp()</code> is the one flaw with this
test, the sizes of the <code>memcmp()</code> don't vary, hopefully the data will be
'random' enough that we can still observe differences in the two
approaches.</p>
<p>My approach for testing involved getting the delta of <code>ktime_get()</code>
across calls to <code>memcmp()</code> in <code>memcmp_pages()</code> (mm/ksm.c). This actually
generated massive amounts of data, so, for consistency the following
analysis is performed on the first 400MB of deltas collected.</p>
<p>The host was compiled with <code>powernv_defconfig</code> and run out of a
ramdisk. For consistency the host was rebooted between each run so as
to not have any previous tests affect the next. The host was rebooted
a total of six times, the first three with my 'patched'
<code>power8_memcmp()</code> kernel was booted the second three times with just
my data collection patch applied, the 'vanilla' kernel. Both
kernels are based off <code>4.13-rc3</code>.</p>
<p>Each boot the following script was run and the resulting deltas file
saved somewhere before reboot. The command line argument was always
15.</p>

<p>The guest kernel was a <code>pseries_le_defconfig</code> <code>4.13-rc3</code> with the same
ramdisk the host used. It booted to the login prompt and was left to
idle.</p>
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>A variety of histograms were then generated in an attempt to see how
the behaviour of <code>memcmp()</code> changed between the two implementations.
It should be noted here that the y axis in the following graphs is a
log scale as there were a lot of small deltas. The first observation
is that the vanilla kernel had more smaller deltas, this is made
particularly evident by the 'tally' points which are a running total
of all deltas with less than the tally value.</p>
<p><img alt="Sample 1 - Deltas below 200ns" src="/images/power8_memcmp/deltas1-200.png" title="Sample 1: Deltas below 200ns">
Graph 1 depicting the vanilla kernel having a greater amount of small
(sub 20ns) deltas than the patched kernel. The green points rise
faster (left to right) and higher than the yellow points.</p>
<p>Still looking at the tallies, <a href="/images/power8_memcmp/deltas1-200.png" title="Sample 1: Deltas below 200ns">graph 1</a> also shows that the tally
of deltas is very close by the 100ns mark, which means that the
overhead of <code>power8_memcmp()</code> is not too great.</p>
<p>The problem with looking at only deltas under 200ns is that the
performance results we want, that is, the difference between the
algorithms is being masked by things like cache effects. To avoid this
problem is may be wise to look at longer running (larger delta)
<code>memcmp()</code> calls.</p>
<p>The following graph plots all deltas below 5000ns - still relatively
short calls to <code>memcmp()</code> but an interesting trend emerges:
<img alt="Sample 1 - Deltas below 5000ns" src="/images/power8_memcmp/deltas1-5000.png" title="Sample 1: Deltas below 5000ns">
Graph 2 shows that above 500ns the blue (patched kernel) points appear
to have all shifted left with respect to the purple (vanilla kernel)
points. This shows that for any <code>memcmp()</code> which will take more than
500ns to get a result it is favourable to use <code>power8_memcmp()</code> and it
is only detrimental to use  <code>power8_memcmp()</code> if the time will be
under 50ns (a conservative estimate).</p>
<p>It is worth noting that <a href="/images/power8_memcmp/deltas1-200.png" title="Sample 1: Deltas below 200ns">graph 1</a> and <a href="/images/power8_memcmp/deltas1-5000.png" title="Sample 1: Deltas below 5000ns">graph 2</a> are generated by
combining the first run of data collected from the vanilla and patched
kernels. All the deltas for both runs are can be viewed separately
<a href="/images/power8_memcmp/vanilla_deltas1.png" title="All vanilla deltas">here for vanilla</a> and <a href="/images/power8_memcmp/patched_deltas1.png" title="All patched deltas">here for patched</a>. Finally, the results
from the other four runs look very much identical and provide me with
a fair amount of confidence that these results make sense.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>It is important to separate possible KSM optimisations with generic
<code>memcmp()</code> optimisations, for example, perhaps KSM shouldn't be
calling <code>memcmp()</code> if it suspects the first byte will differ. On the
other hand, things that <code>power8_memcmp()</code> could do (which it currently
doesn't) is check the length parameter and perhaps avoid the overhead
of enabling kernel vector if the compare is less than some small
amount of bytes.</p>
<p>It does seem like at least for the 'average case' glibcs
<code>power8_memcmp()</code> is an improvement over what we have now.</p>
<h2>Future work</h2>
<p>A second round of data collection and plotting of delta vs position of
first byte to differ should confirm these results, this would mean a
more invasive patch to KSM.</p> </div><!-- /.entry-content -->
